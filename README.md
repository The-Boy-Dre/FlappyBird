The code for the Flappy Bird game was packaged into an executable file using the pyinstaller program shortly after it's production. 
So to run this app, you'll need to download the files as one singular zip file, then  extract it when it's finsihed downloading and then go into 
the FlappyBird_-master folder and run the exectable file from there.
